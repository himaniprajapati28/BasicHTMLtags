      <p>Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most celebrated festivals in India and among Hindu communities worldwide. It marks the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. The festival is celebrated by lighting oil lamps or diyas, decorating homes with colorful rangoli designs, and bursting fireworks. Diwali also signifies the return of Lord Rama to his kingdom after 14 years of exile, as described in the ancient Indian epic, the Ramayana. Families come together during Diwali to offer prayers, exchange gifts, and share festive meals. The sweet aroma of traditional sweets fills the air, as people indulge in delicacies like laddoos and barfis. It is a time for renewal and cleaning, as homes are thoroughly cleaned and decorated to invite prosperity and good fortune. Diwali is not only a religious occasion but also a cultural celebration that promotes unity, love, and compassion. The festival encourages generosity, with people donating to the less fortunate. Diwali, with its vibrant celebrations and deep cultural significance, brings joy and happiness to millions across the world.
